# decomposed-torus-godot-4.5
A simple Godot 4.5 code with a decomposed torus with each face shaking and moving with little speed.
<br>
You can use and modify for any use. 
<b> Inspired by https://codepen.io/boytchev/pen/RNPyxoQ </b>

## Example scene
You can change the color by export variable before launching the scene or by shader parameters while scene is running. The speed of faces movement can be changed inside of shader parameters.

## .exe and gif of rendering
To see more easily the result (for example if you don't have Godot), you can download the .7z file that is part of the repository files, then uncompress it. In it, you will find a .exe, launch it. <br> If you don't want to download the .exe, <br>
here is a gif (please note that the gif is laggy, due to the conversion of mp4 to gif, so we recommend to download the .7z) <br>
